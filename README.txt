PII Masking using LLMs

Project Overview

This project focuses on masking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names and emails using transformer models and Large Language Models (LLMs). The pipeline includes data processing, model training, and evaluation, with a reproducible notebook for testing the trained model.

Run the Reproducible Notebook:
Open 04_masking_pipeline.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to test the trained model.
change the example input sequence as per your choice and run.

Process Breakdown

Step 1: Preprocess raw data and add emails (01_data_processing_adding_emails.ipynb).

Step 2: Validate the processed dataset (02_few further checkups.ipynb).

Step 3: Train a transformer model for PII detection (03_model_training.ipynb).

Step 4: Use 04_masking_pipeline.ipynb to test the trained model on random texts.

Step 5: Implement zero-shot PII masking with a smaller LLM (05_Zero_shot_PII_masking_Using_LLM.ipynb).

Model Training and Evaluation

Uses a transformer-based model for entity recognition and masking.

Evaluates model performance using precision, recall, FNR, FPR and F1-score.

Testing the Model

The 04_masking_pipeline.ipynb notebook is the a testing script.

Load the trained model from saved_models3/ and test it on new text samples.
